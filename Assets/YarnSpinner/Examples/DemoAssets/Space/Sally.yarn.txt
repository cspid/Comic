Most days I wait til i hear his car pull out of the driveway before I get up. It's not that I don't want to see him - I get along pretty well with my dad. 
Sally: Same old nebula, doing the same old thing.
Sally: Oh, Ship wanted to see you. Go say hi to it.
<<set $should_see_ship to true>>
<<if visited("Ship") is true>>
    Player: Already done!
    Sally: Go say hi again.
