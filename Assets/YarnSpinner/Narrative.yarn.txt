Mine's Elin. Really it's Elinka but she's not having it, not since fourth grade. I'm not sure if someone said something to her or what, but one day she came home from school and she was Elin.
[[Did that bother you?|Bother]]
[[That's a nice name too.|Nice]]

No, it didn't. Her mother called her Elinka right to the end, it would drive her to fits, slamming doors - real teenage soap stuff.

So I know you said you were done, but I hate to drink alone. At least humor me and let me and keep the bottle on the table.
[[Uh, I guess. Sure.]]
